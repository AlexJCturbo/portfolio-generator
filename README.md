## Project Description
This project is a Portfolio Generator built using Node.js and JavaScript. The project is an application that generates an HTML file with a portfolio page. The application uses the inquirer npm package to request information in the command line regarding the users' projects to build the portfolio. Then, using the File System module, the application creates the  HTML file. Finally, the CSS style is provided by a template that is copied using the fs.copyFile method. The code runs using a chain of Promises that are linked by .then method.
